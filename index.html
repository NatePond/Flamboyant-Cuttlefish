<Header>The Flamboyant Cuttlefish!</Header>

<p>Cuttlefish, Octupi, Squid, and Nautilus are knwon as cephalopods. They each have distinct eviolutionary advantages with specific traits unique to specific species</p>

<p>The Flamboyant Cuttlefish is a particularly interesting case. First of all, it looks crazy. Like if this thing was human sized and it was walking towards you, you'd run into a fit of insanity and probably be put away in a mental ward. And That's one of the unique things about this cuttlefish. It runs! Like many other species of cuttlefish this creature can change it's shape, size and color to mimic other animals. This one in particular crawls around on its legs despite being able to use propulsian to swim around.</p>

<p>This creature may looks poisionous but this is just a deception and it will aggresively charge a much more formidable creature in order to intimidate its predators. These creatures are some of the smartest animals on the planet.</p>
